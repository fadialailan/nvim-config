this is a backup of my neovim config, you are free to fork it and/or borrow any

## Notes

* most LSPs will need to be installed localy before they work, you can find a list
of LSPs and how to install them in the lsp-config repo documentaion [link](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md)
